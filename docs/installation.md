# Installation

The Argonne Discovery SDK required [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.7+.

If a supported version of Python is not already installed on your system, see this [Python installation guide](https://docs.python-guide.org/)

* We highly suggest using [pipenv](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/#installing-pipenv).

Assuming you have python installed on your system all you need to start using the command-line utilities is to have this package installed:
```
pip install adc-sdk
```
